# Newton Raphson implementation

`newton_raphson.py` contains an implementation of the Newton-Raphson
algorithm that finds roots of an equation. This one is set up to
compute the roots of `x^3 - x - 1`.

However, there are no tests (shock, horror!).

1) Create a test file and add some tests, making sure the code passes using `pytest`!
   Remember to lint and type your tests.

2) Feed the code and your tests into a tool like Gemini and ask it to assess the
   quality of your tests: investigate test coverage and see if there are
   any things that your tests missed.

3) (Optional extension) Modify the code to be more flexible in the function it
   computes the roots of (i.e. not just `x^3 - x - 1`). What tests would you add?
