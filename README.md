# Unit Testing

There are 5 exercises to work though, in increasing order of challenge.
Some have failing tests, some require tests adding, others have tests
but no code.

Each directory has a `README.md` file with more detailed instructions.
You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all the tools
required for this exercise are installed.
