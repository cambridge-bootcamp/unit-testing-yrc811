# Password Generator

1) Read and understand the `password_generator.py` code.

2) Build out the tests in `test_password_generator.py`. Two are provided
   to start you off, but you should be able to come up with at least ten
   more tests for the code.  

3) Think about *coverage* -- i.e. what proportion of the lines
   of code do your tests actually check? The ideal is 100% of course, but
   it is better to ensure the critical lines are covered first.

   An extension to `pytest` called `pytest-cov` can give you information
   about lines of coverage. `pip install pytest-cov`, and then try
   `pytest --cov=password_generator test_password_generator.py`.

4) With your neighbours, compare the tests you created.
