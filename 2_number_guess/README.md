# Number guessing

1) Run the code with `python number_guess.py` and then review the code.

2) Notice how it is not working and the code is incomplete - it should
   be telling you whether your guess is higher, lower etc. 

   There are already some tests for the correct behaviour. 
   Run `pytest number_guess.py` and confirm that the tests are failing.

3) Fix the code and make sure the tests pass.
